Files to convert a docker image to a singularity image

Ideally you would run this on a host that had both Docker and
Singularity installed and sudo to root available, but I didn't have
such a host.

So I exported from eht-work (google cloud, Docker installed) and built
the Singularity module cfa fringes, which I installed Singularity

* Export the docker image to tar.gz

* Put this .tar.gz file someplace on a webserver

* use "sudo singularity build greg-difx-2.5.1.img greg-difx-2.5.1.def" to
import the docker image into a singularity image

* with the .tar.gz on the web visible to the outside world, you can
probably build this remote without needing sudo:

  "singularity remote login"
  <paste your token from https://cloud.sylabs.io/builder>
  "singularity build --remote greg-difx-2.5.1.img greg-difx-2.5.1.def"

* When I originally made this, I thought I tried all of the options,
but, on third thought, you can apparently do "sudo singularity build
greg-difx-2-5.1.tar.gz
