In create-nodes.py, all 3 auth modes work

For service account usage with API code like "Ray":
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=eht-cloud-b038a415dc0d.json

BOOTSTRAPPING MY CUSTOM IMAGE

delete existing libcloud* instance
python create-image-node.py

Now you have a running instance named libcloud-test-greg-service-account

log in and install stuff

click ssh button
sudo -H bash
apt update
apt dist-upgrade
apt install -y openmpi-common openmpi-bin

apt -y install python3 emacs25
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3 1
apt-get -y install python3-pip
update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/pip pip /usr/bin/pip3 1

# still as root
pip install paramsurvey[ray] boto3
# hangs installing grpcio

# went back a second time, didn't do that



stopped instance via cli

NOW MAKE A CUSTOM IMAGE FROM IT

compute engine -> left bar storage -> images -> pick libcloud-test-greg-service-account -> regional us-central1 -> name greg-test -> create
