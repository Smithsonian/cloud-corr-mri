pip install google-api-python-client  # it's in the ray venv
pip install boto3  # not an explcit dependendy, needed by "ray exec"

export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/glindahl/github/cloud-corr-mri/libcloud/eht-cloud-b038a415dc0d.json"

Test that it's working at all:
pip install google-cloud-storage
python ./google-test.py

# https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/config.html#minimal-configuration
I added what was needed to get it to work with 1.9.3 and 2.0.0.dev0

note that running things the ray way needs ray.init(address='auto')
