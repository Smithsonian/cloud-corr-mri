I now have a quota for 4096 c2 and 10k c2d nodes
  in the us-centra1-c availability zone
they want me to use preemptable nodes for c2d

c2-standard-60  # quota 4096 cores
c2d-highcpu-112  # quota 10k cores

./make-yaml.py base-template.yml machineType c2-standard-60 resources '{"CPU": 60}'


actual quota is
  us-central1-c c2d unlimited
  us-central1-c c2 unlimited
some other quotes show as 500 cores?!

500 cores is 4 c2d or 8 c2

c2.7 works
c2d.3 works

c2.20 does not work
   started 20:29
   2022-08-20 20:36:50,807 INFO autoscaler.py:469 -- StandardAutoscaler: Terminating the node with id ray-gce-ray-minimal-greg-worker-fe2fb1a0-compute and ip 10.128.0.145. (max_workers_per_type)

In the ray tests it's manipulated like this: config["available_node_types"]["p2.8xlarge"]["min_workers"] = 3

that's 20 for c2.20
it managed to start 10 workers before this started happening

AUTOSCALER_MAX_CONCURRENT_LAUNCHES defaults to 10
AUTOSCALER_MAX_LAUNCH_BATCH defaults to 5
